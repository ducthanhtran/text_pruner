You may know him Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter The New York Times
Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden name wrote book which famously exposed NSA illegally wiretapping phone calls Americans
But another chapter book may even more lasting impact
In describes catastrophic intelligence operation which CIA quite literally handed over blueprints nuclear bomb Iran
If sounds crazy go read
incredible story
But know didn chapter

For nearly decade afterwards subject investigation which prosecutors demanded testify against alleged sources
along way became face recent pattern prosecuting whistleblowers spying journalists
You under First Amendment press right publish secret public interest
But impossible exercise right if media also gather news protect identities brave men women them
when came knocking did what many brave reporters done before him refused said 'd rather go jail
2007 2015 lived under specter going federal prison
That until days before trial when curious thing happened
Suddenly after years claiming vital case dropped demands altogether
turns out age electronic surveillance very few places reporters sources hide
instead trying failing testify they could digital trail testify against him instead
completely secret without consent prosecutors got phone records
They got email records financial banking credit reports even travel records with list flights had taken
among they used convict Jeffrey Sterling alleged source CIA whistleblower
Sadly only case many
President Obama ran promise protect whistleblowers instead Justice Department prosecuted more than other administrations combined
could problem especially because considers so much what does secret
Since 9 11 virtually every important story national security result whistleblower coming journalist
risk seeing press unable do job First Amendment supposed protect because expanded ability spy everyone
But technology allowed circumvent reporters rights press also use technology protect sources even better than before
they start moment they begin speaking with them rather than witness stand after fact
Communications software now exists wasn available when writing book much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails phone calls
For example such tool SecureDrop open-source whistleblower submission system originally created by late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz now developed non-profit where work Freedom Press Foundation
Instead sending email go news organization website here The Washington Post
From upload document send much would any other contact form
'll then encrypted stored server only news organization access
no longer secretly demand much they would demand wouldn available first place
SecureDrop though really only small part puzzle protecting press freedom 21st century
Unfortunately governments over constantly developing new spying techniques put risk
up going forward make sure tech-savvy whistleblowers Edward Snowden avenue exposing wrongdoing
vital protect next veteran health care whistleblower alerting overcrowded hospitals next environmental worker sounding alarm Flint dirty water Wall Street insider warning next financial crisis
After these tools weren built help brave men women expose crimes but meant protect our rights under Constitution

On April 3 2016 saw largest data leak history The Panama Papers exposed rich powerful people hiding vast amounts money accounts What does mean called Robert Palmer Global Witness explain This week whole slew deluge stories coming out leak 11 million documents Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca
The release these papers Panama lifts veil tiny piece secretive
insight into clients banks lawyers go companies Mossack Fonseca say OK want anonymous company give
actually emails exchanges messages mechanics works operates
already started pretty immediate repercussions
The Prime Minister Iceland resigned
've also had news ally brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad also got companies
There allegations 2 billion money trail leads back President Vladimir Putin Russia via close childhood friend happens top cellist
will lot rich individuals out others will nervous next set stories next set leaked documents
sounds plot spy thriller John Grisham novel
seems very distant me ordinary people
Why should care
But truth if rich powerful individuals able keep money pay taxes they should means less money vital public services healthcare education roads
affects
my organization Global Witness exposé phenomenal
media political leaders talking individuals use secrecy hide disguise assets -- something talking exposing decade
think lot people find entire baffling confusing hard understand sort works
think bit Russian doll
company stacked inside another company stacked inside another company making almost impossible really understand behind these structures
very difficult law enforcement tax authorities journalists civil society really understand what going
also think interesting less coverage issue United States
perhaps because some prominent people haven figured exposé scandal
because no rich Americans stashing assets
because way which works Mossack Fonseca fewer American clients
think if saw leaks Cayman Islands even Delaware Wyoming Nevada would many more cases examples linking back Americans
In fact number states less provide less company than do library card
That sort secrecy America allowed employees school districts rip off schoolchildren
allowed scammers rip off vulnerable investors
This sort behavior affects
Global Witness wanted what actually looked practice How does actually work
what did sent undercover investigator 13 Manhattan law firms
Our investigator posed African minister wanted move suspect funds into United States buy house yacht jet
what truly shocking but those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions move those suspect funds
These were preliminary meetings none lawyers took client course no money moved hands but really shows problem with system
also important think individual cases
This individual lawyer spoken our undercover investigator provided suggestions
particular senior politician caught up scandal
This system works entrenches corruption tax evasion poverty instability
order tackle change game
change rules game make sort behavior harder
This may seem doom gloom nothing do nothing ever changed will always rich powerful individuals
But natural optimist do starting some change
Over last couple years 've seen real push towards greater transparency when comes company ownership
This issue put political agenda by UK Prime Minister David Cameron big G8 Summit held Northern Ireland 2013
since then European Union going creating central registers national level really owns controls companies across Europe
One things sad actually lagging behind
There bipartisan legislation had introduced House Senate but isn making much progress 'd
'd really want Panama leaks huge peek into used way opening up around
For Global Witness moment change
ordinary people angry way which people hide identity behind secret companies
business leaders stand up say Secrecy good business
political leaders recognize problem commit changing law open up sort secrecy
Together end secrecy currently allowing tax evasion corruption money laundering flourish
